# Build

* init
  Sync CyanogenMod source:

        # repo init -u git://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b cm-13.0
        
        # repo sync

* PS: Don't forget to merge my pivate source to upstream. Pivate source including:
        
        # external/openssl
        # external/skia 
        # frameworks/base  
        # frameworks/native
        # frameworks/opt/telephony
        # packages/services/Telephony 
        # system/core
        # system/netd

* Such as in folder "system/core", do openning Terminal:
        
        # git remote add upstream https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_system_core.git
        # git fetch upstream cm-12.1
        # git merge upstream/cm-12.1

* full build
        
        # source build/envsetup.sh

        # brunch cm_HM2014011-userdebug

# Limitations

Services requires root:

`system/core/rootdir/init.rc`

  * surfaceflinger depends on sched_setscheduler calls, unable to change process priority from 'system' user (default user 'system')

  * mediaserver depends on /data/nvram folder access, unable to do voice calls from 'media' user (default user 'media')

# In China, we must skip to get 204 from Google server.
  * Change of Android 5.1 source to skip network validation in some environment like China can't connect to http://clients3.google.com/generate_204.
